# sho sites

Website for sho sites — the small studio run by Shourya Batra that builds fast, clean brochure websites for orgs, clubs, and businesses ($5–$25 depending on complexity). Most projects take about 1–2 weeks once content is ready.

## What this site covers

- Approach: AI-assisted drafts refined by hand, mobile-first builds focused on clarity and speed.

## Key pages

- Work: portfolio links (Homestead CS Club, L.I.F.T., Astrophysics Club, personal site, this site).
- Process: plan → design → build → review → launch, plus a short client checklist.
- Start: Formspree contact form for new projects and direct email.
- FAQ: pricing, update workflow, scope fit, and the tech used.
- About me: brief bio on Shourya and the tools he prefers.
